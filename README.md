The Gaussian Visualizer is an interactive educational tool for exploring normal (Gaussian) distributions and process capability metrics, ideal for students, engineers, and data enthusiasts.

**Key Features:**

- **Live Distribution Chart:**

  - Adjust the mean, standard deviation, and specification limits (LSL/USL) to see the normal curve update instantly.
  - Visualize the impact of changes on the shape and spread of the distribution.

- **Process Capability Metrics:**

  - Instantly calculate and display Pp, Ppk, and PPM (defects per million) as you adjust parameters.
  - See how process centering and spread affect capability indices.

- **Educational Tooltips:**

  - Hover over controls and metrics to get clear, concise explanations of statistical concepts.
  - Learn the formulas and significance of each metric in context.

- **Modern, Responsive UI:**
  - Built with React and TypeScript for a smooth, interactive experience.
  - Clean, professional design that works on all devices.

**Tech Stack:**

- React & TypeScript for robust component architecture
- Chart.js for high-performance data visualization
- SCSS for maintainable styling
- Vite for fast development and optimized builds
